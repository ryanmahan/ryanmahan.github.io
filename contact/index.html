          <h5 class='is-size-5'>I helped a friend of mine get elected as a selectman in their home town, serving as Communications Director one year and Chair the next. I built a java applet to organize phonebankers, and built an algorithm to sort houses by distance to eachother in order to reduce the amount of time doorknockers would need to spend going from house to house.</h5>
