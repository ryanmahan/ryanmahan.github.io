  text: Originally written as a dashboard for HackUMass, Github wanted to sponsor our team to create a generalized open-source version for general use. With an easy set up, a group can use our dashboard that organizes mentors, attendees, events, prizes, and much more. We're currently writing better documentation, abstracting a lot of the hardcoded branding, and making set up easy as filling in a page of variables.
