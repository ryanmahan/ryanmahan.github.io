Given to my department in coordination with a larger push for developing reusable resources, this presentation fills a knowledge gap of setting up, developing, and publishing NPM packages designed for react applications. A combination of NPM package mechanics and design paradigms for creating maintainable and highly configurable libraries, this presentation helped my department increase code reusability. Alongside this presenation, I developed an internal react hooks library based off of a template repository that would enable other developers to start on their library ideas without having to learn the intracacies of build tools.
