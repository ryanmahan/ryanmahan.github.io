Given to various groups at Optum before our peer feedback rounds. This presentation guides feedback givers to a well-crafted message to ensure proper communication of areas for improvement. Feedback receivers are given tips on staying constructive, guiding self-reflection, and how to encourage others to give feedback more often. A main theme throughout the presentation is that feedback is gift worth giving, getting, and working together to properly share.
