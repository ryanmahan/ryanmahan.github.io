Police Data Trust is being created to act as a unified search experience across multiple non-profit police misconduct tracking organizations in order to increase visibility of repeat offenders across municipalities. The project uses Next.js, Python, Flask, and PostgresQL. I contribute full stack, developing the user authentication, session management, and other user managment functionality.
