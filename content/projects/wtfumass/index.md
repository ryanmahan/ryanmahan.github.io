"What to Fix, UMass" was a site developed in my senior year at UMass. As Speaker of the Undergraduate Senate I sought to create a method for students to provide feedback to the instution and vote on topics they'd like to see their representatives focus on. WTFUMass used Vue, Node, and MongoDB. I used firebase for authentication methods, and vueitfy's component library.
