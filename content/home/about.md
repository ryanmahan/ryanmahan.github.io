## I'm Ryan Mahan

I love learning. I'm currently enrolled in the Online Masters of Computer Science program at Georgia Tech. I listen to podcasts constantly, listening to anything NPR will put out. I particularly enjoy [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money/), [Throughline](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510333/throughline), and [Shortwave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave). I have the world's cutest two dogs, who both hate to be in video calls but love the attention. I enjoy tinkering with my 3D printer and whatever electronics or raspberry pi's I can get my hands on.


### And I like to code too.
When the dogs will let me get to my keyboard, I work as a Software Engineer and Delivery Lead at Optum. In my free time, I volunteer for [Code For Boston](http://codeforboston.org).  The more complicated the problem, the more satisfaction I get from solving it. In my code and professional life, I strive for constant growth and adaptation for myself and my teams.
