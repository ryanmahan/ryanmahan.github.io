## Why care about feedback?
In a field that requires it's workers to constantly improve and learn new things, feedback is required for personal and professional growth. Pull requests, peer programming, and the dreaded annual peer reviews are constant exercises in giving and receiving feedback, all through different mediums. Peer reviews let you know how to better work in your team. Pull request comments help you move closer to the elusive "best practice." Peer programming is a tight feedback loop that teaches you implicit knowledge faster than you can alone. Focusing on how to give and receive feedback can help you integrate into a team and learn faster.

In the words of a mentor of mine, "Feedback is a gift." Feedback helps someone improve.

## First, a communications refresher

In every conversation you have a team. A sender and receiver, working together to share some thought. It's incredibly inefficent. The sender has to convert some thought to words, say it with the right tone and body language, then the receiver has to convert that message back to thought. It's messy. It's rife with misunderstandings, biases, and noise.

Feedback is an important message. Misinterpreted feedback is at best useless and at worst offensive. Careful "packaging" and "unpackaging" of feedback is  necessary for success.

## Tips for sending feedback

There are a million frameworks for sending feedback. If one works for you, use it, with the caveat that it also has to work with your receiver. We need to send a message that gets our point across, neatly, nicely, and respectfully. 

Let's define some goals for a sender in a feedback conversation:
  - Be clear and concrete
  - Be focused
  - Provide an opportunity for growth
