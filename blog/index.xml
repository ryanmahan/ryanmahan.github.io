With Copilot, programmers write descriptive comments and function names and Copilot writes the rest. This is hilariously similar to the usual coding interview, which consists of a prompt and a template for a human to fill in with code. What if we replaced the human interviewee with Copilot? Would it generate good enough code to get a job?</description></item><item><title>How does React v18's concurrency improve performance?</title><link>https://ryanlmahan.com/blog/reactconcurrency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 18:27:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ryanlmahan.com/blog/reactconcurrency/</guid><description>The React team has implemented concurrency on a single threaded V8 execution context. How does increased concurrency help when you only have one thread? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how Operating Systems developers were able to increase the performance of their hardware through the CPU scheduler.
First, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the React team&amp;rsquo;s writeup on their concurrency feature, or their more recent React v18 updates you should. They explain how they implemented it and how to use it.</description></item></channel></rss>
