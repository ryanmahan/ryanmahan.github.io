          <h5 class='is-size-5'>I run the Legislative Branch of the UMass Student Government Association. I spend a lot of time explaining and translating complex university structures and empowering the Senators of the Legislative branch to pursue their own changes and projects on the campus. I've been in this position for two years, and maintain regular meetings with UMass Administrators and serve as a primary point of contact for the student voice.</h5>

I built a java applet to organize phonebankers, and built an algorithm to sort houses by distance to eachother in order to reduce the amount of time doorknockers would need to spend going from house to house.</h5>
